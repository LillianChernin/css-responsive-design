How would you write media queries differently if you use max-width versus min-width?

Answer: If you use max-width you should order the media queries decreasing in size
going from top to bottom.  So for instance you would want to position the max-width: 960px
above max-width: 640px in the stylesheet. If you use min-width you would want to do
the opposite and order the media queries increasing in size going from top to bottom.
So small would be above medium which would be above large.
